# Place Turret with Ammo

This mod fills a turret with up to 50 ammo from the player inventory when a
turret is placed.

This only works with "gun-turret" and the following ammo:
  - "uranium-rounds-magazine"
  - "piercing-rounds-magazine"
  - "firearm-magazine"

This is not configurable.

I don't consider this a cheat, but rather an assist.
It doesn't do anything that couldn't be done with quick mouse skills.

I does allow wiping out a biter nest really quick, if you have sufficient ammo
and turret. Pairs nicely with the "extended reach"-type mods.
